  DevNote: This event is called by the Grid Controller when the blocks are shaking
    to switch to a different block. The reason this event is not called by the Spot
    Animation Controller is that if so, every instance of a spot will cause the Audio
    manager to instantiate an Audio Source to play their own sound effect caused
    by their own callbacks.
